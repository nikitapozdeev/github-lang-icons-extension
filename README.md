# GitHub Language Icons Extension

Just out of curiosity, I came up with a useless idea for a browser extension.

It is not put in the store because it is rather useless and does not work for client rendering, which in principle can be solved by tracking the DOM mutation

It also uses the [devicon](https://devicon.dev/) icon set, in which some of the icons do not fit well with the design of the github.
